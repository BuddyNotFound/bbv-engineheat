**Engine Heat** is  a simple standalone script that makes your vehicle's engine heat up if you drive too fast. When you go faster than the speed limit set in the config, the engine starts heating up. If the temperature goes higher than the limit set in the config, the engine starts wearing down slowly. If it gets too hot, the engine stops working completely until it cools down below the maximum temperature.

This resource utilizes the native temperature data from the game. This means that the vehicle's temperature will be shown on the dashboard or HUDs that display temperature information.

You may need to adjust the configuration values to better suit your server. The current values are set for testing purposes only. The script works on 0.00ms and may spike to 0.01ms if debug mode is enabled.
